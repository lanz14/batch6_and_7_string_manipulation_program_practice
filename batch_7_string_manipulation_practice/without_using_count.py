# user's input
user_input = input("Input a string: ")

# ask the user a single character to count within a string
char_count = input("Character to count (e.g. letter 'a'): ")

# if the user did not enter a single character, it will alert the user to input only single character to count
# if the user input a single character, it will print the amount of times it appeared
